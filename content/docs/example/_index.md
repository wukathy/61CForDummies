# So you're 4 weeks behind...

## This is the book for you.

We condensed the whole semester of CS61C into one easily crammable, **dummy friendly** guide! Review this before finals, while creating your cheat sheet, or just crying in main stacks. Don't worry, you got this. We believe in ya.

## Study Tips
- Make a cheat sheet! This helps you consolidate information. Alternatively, if you're running short on time, just use ours.
- Take the relevant practice exams for your semester / professor
- Study with a friend and explain shit to each other


## Origin Story

It was dead week, fall 2019. Most of the class has inevitably fallen behind in lecture, doomed to learn a whole semester's content in just one short week. The authors of this book suffered a similar fate. The solution? A humble 36 page [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFq54T4Ds3aZ79AUAL6vwJhKdes3ds4dyMvvXCXX8uY/edit#) that outlined just about everything you need to know in 61C (made in one night too! creds @jessica yu). We've since upgraded to the website, but the original sentiment is the same. Take all the content from lecture, discussion, labs, and TA review, and put it all into one convenient place for you fellow procrastinators.

## Credits
Unless otherwise noted, all content is taken directly from lecture slides, TA review slides, or discussion worksheets. Do not hesitate to **suggest edits** if there is misinformation, we are just dumb bears like you all!
